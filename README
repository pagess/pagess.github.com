I made this page so you can reach something useful for your life if you are
trying to reach pages.github.com and misspelled it :)
This will lead you to http://stockrt.github.com, my official projects page.

From the official stockrt's page:
My projects' name and description are dynamically listed, and this is
somewhat cool.
You can copy the generation samples from here and use it to make your own
personal page for 'yournickname.github.com'.
If you are going to use my code, please keep the reference.
